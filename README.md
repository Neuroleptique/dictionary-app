# Dictionary web app

In this project, you'll integrate with the Dictionary API to create a real-world dictionary web app. Your challenge is to build out this dictionary web app using the following [Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/).

Your users should be able to:

- Search for words using the input field
- See the Free Dictionary API's response for the searched word
- See a form validation message when trying to submit a blank form
- Switch between light and dark themes
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Bonus: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. Hint: Research prefers-color-scheme in CSS.

Additional Features include:

- Play the audio file for a word when it's available
- Switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts

## Development

After you've forked and cloned the repo on to your local machine, go to the project directory and install the dependencies.

```bash
cd dictionary-app && npm install
```

To start the local server on port `3000`:

```bash
npm run dev
```
